/*
The aserto package provides access to the Aserto authorizer and supporting service.

Authorization requests are performed using an AuthorizerClient.
A client can be used on its own to make authorization calls or, more commonly, it can be used to create server
middleware.

AuthorizerClient

The AuthorizerClient interface, defined in "github.com/aserto-dev/go-authorizer/aserto/authorizer/v2",
describes the operations exposed by the Aserto authorizer service.

Two implementation of AuthorizerClient are available:

1. `authorizer/grpc` provides a client that communicates with the authorizer using gRPC.

2. `authorizer/http` provides a client that communicates with the authorizer over its REST HTTP endpoints.


Middleware

Two middleware implementations are available in subpackages:

1. middleware/grpc provides middleware for gRPC servers.

2. middleware/http provides middleware for HTTP REST servers.

When authorization middleware is configured and attached to a server, it examines incoming requests, extracts
authorization parameters like the caller's identity, calls the Aserto authorizers, and rejects messages if their
access is denied.


Other Services

In addition to the authorizer service, aserto-go provides gRPC clients for Aserto's administrative services,
allowing users to programmatically manage their aserto account.

There are two top-level services, each with its own set of sub-services.

1. `client/authorizer` defines a client for services run at the edge and used to serve authorization requests.
2. `client/tenant` defines the control-plane services used to configure authorizers.
